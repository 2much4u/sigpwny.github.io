This meeting is structured a little differently than other ones. The "challenges" are meant to encourage members to secure their digital accounts and apply the methods of OpSec they are being taught. The meeting covers the basics of how to not get pwned, whether your threat model is state-funded agencies or avoiding email malware. It'll go over strategies used by CIA operatives and chief information security officers (CISOs)as well as strategies that may be more immediately applicable.
