Being comfortable with the UNIX command line is an essential skill for CTF's and other security activities.
The best way to learn the command line is to use it. A great place to try a CTF and learn the command line
is http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html. Warning, some of the later levels (20+) can be broken sometimes
