For this meeting, we described how the web worked through servers and clients. We introduced OWASP's top 10 vulnerabilities (e.g. cross-site scripting) and warned against unauthorized access to servers. The rest of the time was spent either playing Gruyere, a codelab created by Google that walks through different web vulnerabilities, or Natas at Over the Wire, which teaches web security through a series of games. Gruyere helps teach vulnerabilities by explaining and giving an example of an exploit and shows how to fix it.
